My motivation for creating this project was a willingness to develop my first app in the history.
This project was built because in future I would like to create applications that use a lot of different outer API's data and are useful for people around the globe.
By using this app, any user around the world can check what's the time/date/another time specification at their location and read some good quotes.
From the project I've learnt to stay humble and progress on coding. I also learnt that I am capaple of coding using React JS library.
